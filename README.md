# MemoryCollector
This project is a project of remembrance. The interface is labeled Contacts and there is an Add Contact+ button on the right. When the button is pressed, a name is printed that generates random data (faker js). There is a delete icon next to the name. There is a Chevron icon on the right. When you click on it, albums belonging to that name are displayed. Again, there is an Add Album+ button on the right. Faker randomly generates names from js for the place visited. Again, there is a delete icon on the left. There is a Chevron icon on the right. When you click on it, it shows the pictures of that traveled place. Again, there is an Add Photo+ button on the left. Faker brings random photos from js. There is a delete icon on the incoming photos. When you click on it, it deletes the pictures.
