# MemoryCollector
This project is a memory reminder project. It is designed using Redux Toolkit. The interface is labeled as Contacts on the left side and there is an Add Contact+ button on the right side. When the button is pressed, a name is printed, which generates random data using faker js. Next to the name is a delete icon. On the right side there is a Chevron icon. Clicking on it displays the albums for that name. There is also an Add Album+ button on the right side. When clicked, Faker js generates random names for the visited place. Again there is a delete icon on the left side. There is a Chevron icon on the right side. When you click on it, it shows the pictures of the visited place. There is also an Add Photo+ button on the left. Faker brings random photos from js. There is a delete icon on the incoming photos. When you click it, it deletes the pictures.
